# Horiseon Code Accessibility Refactor

## Description
The motivation for this project was to update Horiseon's existing code base so that it would be more accessible using semantic HTML/CSS language.
The goal of this project was to help ensure Horiseon's page follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines.
This updated codebase removes vague html syntax and gives the webpage a logical flow by using semantic html elements.
Through completing this update I was able to better learn how to condense CSS selectors and properties and practice leaving useful comments for future developers.
